# Smart Emergency Light System
#### (with Battery Management, USB Output, and MCU Control)
This is an advanced emergency lighting solution powered by a 10,000mAh 6V battery (2 Ã— 6V 5Ah in parallel) and managed by a PIC12F675 microcontroller. 
It integrates intelligent LED panel control, smart automatic charging, USB power output, status indication, manual override, and safety features like current limiting and relay-based automatic cutoff.

Unlike basic emergency lights, this system operates as a smart power hub, designed for efficient battery usage, real-time 
power status monitoring, and enhanced user interaction. It is optimized to extend battery life and deliver reliable backup power intelligently.
